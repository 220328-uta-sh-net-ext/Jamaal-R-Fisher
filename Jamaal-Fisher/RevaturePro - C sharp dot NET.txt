What are the major app models?
You might wonder which frameworks support which app models. Use the following table to map an app model to a .NET framework.

App model	Framework				Notes
Web		ASP.NET Core				The framework for building server-side logic.
Web		ASP.NET Core MVC			The framework for building server-side logic for web pages or web APIs.
Web		ASP.NET Core Razor Pages		The framework for building server-generated HTML.
Web client	Blazor					Blazor is a part of ASP.NET Core. Its two modes allow for either Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation via sockets as a communication vehicle for running server-side code, or a WebAssembly implementation for running compiled C# on a browser.
Desktop		WinForms				A framework for building "battleship gray" Windows-style applications.
Desktop		Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)	A framework for building dynamic desktop applications that conform to different form factors. WPF allows form elements to perform movement, fades, glides, and other effects with the help of a rich library of animations.
Mobile		Xamarin					Allows .NET developers to build apps for iOS and Android devices.

A for loop is constructed with an optional counting variable declaration, a loop condition, and a manipulation statement.
(initializer, condition, iterator)



for (int count = 1; count < 6; ++count)
	Console.Out.WriteLine("count is " + count);


int[] arr = { 1, 3, 5 };
foreach (int i in arr)
	Console.Out.WriteLine(i + " ");

Debugging

BreakPoint is a flag or marker indicating a place to pause the current execution of a program.

Step Into (F11), Step Over (F10), and Continue (F5) are commands for controlling Debugging process.

Step Into - execute just the current code statement
Step Over - execute entire block and go to the next code statement
Step Out - useful when inside a code block to complete execution and go to the end of the code block.
red square - stops program execution, quits debugging, closes any open watch windows, and returns to code editor.

SQL (Structured Query Language)

DDL (Data Definition Language) - statements that define database structure or scheme, like CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
DML (Data Manipulation Language) - statements used for managing data within tables, like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
TCL (Transaction Control Language) - manages how DML statements are issued and executed. (WHERE, FROM)  ??

CRUD - create, read, update, delete

4 core objects of ADO.NET Data Providers

SqlConnection - represents connection to the database - connection string - stored in web.config - ConfigurationManager
SqlCommand - command sent to the database for retrieving or manipulating data - used by SqlConnection
SqlDataReader - provides access in read-only operations - uses both SqlConnection and SqlCommand
SqlDataAdapter - stores data in DataSet - disconnected architecture

ASP.NET

Page Life Cycle  ->  Start phase (new page or post-back, request and response) -> Init phase  (assign unique IDs, themes applied, retrieving master page) ->  Load phase  (loads info, perform validation, data binding)
->  Render phase (metadata/page saved in a state object, converted to HTML code and returned)  -> Unload phase  (clean-up process on the web server that releases unused resources)

Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.  it's complied/transpiled to JavaScript

offers support for interfaces, abstraction, datatypes like enums and never

type conversion
modular design
modifiers

use npm to install typescript

floating-point numbers
decimal
hex
binary
octal

let is an alternative of var
string is a text-based value in single or double quotes
backtick ` creates a string template
expression is an evaluated statement enclosed by brackets and preceded by a $
tuple is an array with a fixed length,   let x: [string, number] = ["hello", 10];
any is a datatype that can be used to represent all possible types
void is for functions that don't return a value
