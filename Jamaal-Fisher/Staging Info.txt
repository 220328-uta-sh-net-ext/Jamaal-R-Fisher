SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is a framework used to evaluate a company's competitive position and to develop strategic planning.
SWOT analysis assesses internal and external factors, as well as current and future potential.

A SWOT analysis is designed to facilitate a realistic, fact-based, data-driven look at the strengths and weaknesses of an organization, initiatives, or within its industry.
The organization needs to keep the analysis accurate by avoiding pre-conceived beliefs or gray areas and instead focusing on real-life contexts.
Companies should use it as a guide and not necessarily as a prescription.


Strengths: Areas you are already excelling in. Your strengths are an assessment of yourself.
For example, a strength may be Strong backend technical skills or Comfortable speaking to strangers. 

Weaknesses: Areas of improvement. Your weaknesses are also an assessment of yourself.
For example, a weakness may be User experience design or Nervous under pressure. 

Opportunities: Areas of potential success. Opportunities are an assessment of things outside of yourself, external factors.
For example, an opportunity may be Clients available in an industry I already know well, or Staging is offering a primer on new skills. 

Threats: Areas of potential risk. Threats are an assessment of things outside of yourself, external factors.
For example, a threat may be My laptop is wearing out or I just spilled ketchup on my best suit.


Strengths
1. What is our competitive advantage?
2. What resources do we have?
3. What products are performing well?

Weaknesses
1. Where can we improve?
2. What products are underperforming?
3. Where are we lacking resources?

Opportunities
1. What technology can we use to improve operations?
2. Can we expand our core operations?
3. What new market segments can we explore?

Threats
1. What new regulations threaten operations?
2. What do our competitors do well?
3. What consumer trends threaten business?
